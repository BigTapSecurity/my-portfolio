      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Ramon Tapia. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s in Cybersecurity at St. Philipâ€™s College, having previously earned my Associateâ€™s degree in Cyber Defense at Northeast Lakeview College. While I was accepted into Texas A&M University-San Antonio, I chose to remain with the Alamo Colleges family for a smoother experience. Iâ€™m still considering future graduate studies â€” maybe at TAMUSA or wherever opportunity takes me.</p>

      <p>My journey into tech and cybersecurity is shaped by years of service as a military professional, where I supported real-world operations and intelligence efforts. That experience gave me an edge in understanding tactical coordination, rapid site transitions (hot and cold sites), and securing mission-critical systems under pressure. </p>

      <p>I bring those skills into the tech world, blending field-level insight with hands-on technical work in red and blue team environments. I enjoy building tools, securing networks, and pushing myself to learn advanced offensive and defensive techniques â€” all with the goal of eventually becoming part of a red team.</p>
